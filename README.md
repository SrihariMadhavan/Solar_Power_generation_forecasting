# Solar_Power_generation_forecasting
Solar power production and consumption in India have witnessed remarkable growth and transformation in recent years. With a total solar power generation capacity exceeding 35 gigawatts (GW) as of September 2020, India ranks among the world's largest solar power producers. Government initiatives, incentives, and large-scale solar parks have fueled this capacity expansion. India's commitment to solar energy aligns with its sustainable development goals, providing electricity to remote areas and reducing costs for industries. India had numerous solar power plants and installations across the country, with a wide range of capacities and sizes. India's abundant sunshine, low cloud cover, and diverse geography create favorable conditions for solar production year-round. Motivated by this, we have gathered data from a solar power facility located in near Mumbai, India, to conduct an in-depth analysis of solar production based on the weather conditions.

The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable time series forecasting model for the solar power generation of a solar plant, specifically focusing on the daily power generation. This forecasting model will utilize historical solar power generation data in conjunction with concurrent weather sensor data, including ambient temperature, module temperature, and irradiation. In this project, through the forecasting, we will try to forecast the power generated, analyze components such as trend, seasonality and cycles of occurrence and the occurrence in different times of the week, using models like exponential smoothing, and, ARIMAX. We aim to test the cross correlation and causation of various weather factors on solar power generation.

The dataset contains information related to approximately 1 month performance and output of a solar power plant captured over 15-minute intervals, including various attributes such as date and time stamps, weather conditions, power generation readings, and possibly other relevant data points. Analyzing this dataset can help users gain insights into the efficiency and reliability of solar power generation under different weather conditions and times of the day.
